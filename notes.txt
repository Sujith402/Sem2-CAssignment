			Shopping bill system

Key:
----	Needed to finish before everyone can start making files
---	Needed by end
--	Decide before conceptualizing implementation
-	Can be avoided

	---- New bill	(Enter customer name and phone number)

			-Pages (if multiple)
			---Go to current bill

Split into 4:
	1-- gui for main menu (create provision for storing name nd number in a separate file)
		++ config file for items + utility to search for items (optional but try doing it as the other parts are very simple) 
	2--- ui used to create the bill
	3--- gui for the bill
	4-- printing of the bill
